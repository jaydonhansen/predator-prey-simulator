Serial implementation of Agent-based Predator/Prey simulation

Build and install:
- cd /path/to/predator-prey-simulation
- mkdir build
- cmake ..
- make
To run the application, run "./milestone1".

The parameters are hard-coded in Main.cpp, so you can change them if you wish,
but future implementations will feature command-line arguments.
